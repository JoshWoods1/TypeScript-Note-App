# Overview

I developed a simple note-taking web application using TypeScript. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, which are stored locally using browser's local storage. This project served as an opportunity for me to practice TypeScript syntax and learn about its features such as type annotations, interfaces, and type checking.

My purpose in writing this software was to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and improve my skills as a software engineer. By building a real-world application, I gained practical experience in using TypeScript for web development and learned how to leverage its features to write more robust and maintainable code.
